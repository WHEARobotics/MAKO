# MAKO
Repository of example code and good practices for the Mutable Autonomous Kinetic Object

MAKO is a learning tool for robotics programming and component design.

## Installation

Follow the FRC2025 installation methods.

## Use

Double-click on `Start Command Prompt.bat` from Windows to start a command-
line prompt that has a virtual environment already activated.  You
will know because the prompt will start with something like:

`(.venv) c:\Users\username\Desktop\MAKO>`

The same usage patterns as the FRC2025 repository apply

**Code development and deployment**

* Change directories to the folder with the sub-project code (e.g. code\hello_robot)
* `robotpy --main filename.py deploy` deploys.
* If the filename is robot.py, `robotpy deploy` is sufficient.

**Updating to a new robotpy version, if you are the first**

* Edit the pyproject.toml file in one of the sub-projects to change the robotpy
   version number in the [tool.robotpy] section.
* Run `robotpy sync` from that sub folder, which will fetch the new versions.
* Deploy your code.
* If things work, copy the changed pyproject.toml to the rest of the sub-project
folders.

**Updating to a new robotpy version, if you are not first**

* Pull from GitHub to get the changed pyproject.toml files.
* Run `robotpy sync` from one of the sub-project folders to fetch the new versions.
