# MAKO
Repository of example code and good practices for the Mutable Autonomous Kinetic Object

MAKO is a learning tool for robotics programming and component design.

The plan is to start with just a roboRIO and some supporting electronics, and build up pieces
of code and hardware as we go.


# Structure of folders in this repository

* code/
* code/sensors/ - reading various sensors
* code/command_based/ - exploration of the "command based" robot framework.
* custom_electronics/ - designs for autonomous switch, optical sensor, terminal block holder
* doc - various documentation
* doc/datasheets â€“ datasheets for roboRIO, VRM, other components
* tools/ - batch files to assist opening command prompts in the right environment, updating
code, etc.
